        "description":"Swift is a programming language for creating iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. Swift builds on the best of C and Objective-C, without the constraints of C compatibility. Swift adopts safe programming patterns and adds modern features to make programming easier, more flexible, and more fun. Swiftâ€™s clean slate, backed by the mature and much-loved Cocoa and Cocoa Touch frameworks, is an opportunity to reimagine how software development works.<br /><br />\nThis book provides:<br />\n- A tour of the language.<br />\n- A detailed guide delving into each language feature.<br />\n- A formal reference for the language.",
